# Bubble-Sort-Binary-Search


# Standard Algorithms Simulator

This repository contains a Standard Algorithms Simulator developed as part of my School Of Now Assessment task 2. The program includes modules for implementing two fundamental algorithms: Bubble Sort and Binary Search. 
- Includes bidirectional navigation and a main menu for ease of use.

## Task Description

As per the client's brief, the task involves developing a Modular Approach to software development, focusing on separating a program's functions into independent pieces or building blocks. Specifically, this task requires the development of a Standard Algorithms Simulator incorporating the following algorithms:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Binary Search

The simulator should also include bidirectional navigation and a main menu for smooth user interaction.

## Algorithm Description

### Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

### Binary Search
Binary Search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array and continues narrowing down the search by halving the search interval in each step.

## Code Overview

The provided code implements the Standard Algorithms Simulator. Here's a brief overview:

- `print_array(arr)`: Function to print the elements of an array.
- `bubble_sort(arr)`: Function to perform bubble sort on an array.
- `binary_search(arr, x)`: Function to perform binary search on a sorted array.
- `main()`: Main function containing the menu and user interface logic.

## Usage

To run the simulator:
(You are required to have an IDE program for debugging purposes, Visual Studio is a good, free application: https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1. Execute the Python script.
  - Download the Python CLI Visual Code plugin
    https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python
  - Download the Python application for your computer platform
    Windows: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
    Mac: https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/
    Linux: https://www.python.org/downloads/source/
2. Choose an option from the main menu:
   - Option 1: Bubble Sort
   - Option 2: Binary Search
   - Option 3: Exit
(Navigate using the numbers on the keyboard OR with the arrow keys)

## Internal Documentation

The code includes intrinsic comments explaining the purpose of implemented modules, variables, and data structures.

## Files Included

- `standard_algorithms_simulator.py`: Python script containing the implementation of the Standard Algorithms Simulator.

## Requirements

The code requires Python 3.x and the `colorama` module for ANSI color support.
